## Presentation Description
Leadership skills are a desirable trait among engineers regardless of whether they ultimately pursue a purely technical, managerial, or hybrid career path. Learning how to lead effectively can have a big impact on the day-to-day operations of meetings, projects, and teams. Whether you are an engineer looking to take on more responsibility within your team as you progress through your role, or an architect considering making the plunge into management responsibilities, you need to explicitly focus on growing your leadership skills in the same manner that you explicitly focus on growing your tech skills.

Over the past few years as an engineer turned architect, and then turned managing architect, I have been living the daily struggle of trying to find the right balance between growing my technical and leadership skills, managing my team's projects and work load, growing a healthy team culture, and in general just doing my best to take care of my team members. In this talk, I'd like to share some practical and actionable advice based on the many things I've learned thus far. We'll cover strategies for learning to make the move into a team contributor role (and the fractured schedules that come with it), for building a healthy team culture, for growing the skills of the members of your team (as a technical or managerial leader), and for growing your leadership skills through study and practice.

## Target Audience
This talk is geared towards anyone who doesn't already feel like they have this whole leadership thing figured out yet (technical roles or not). I won't claim to be an expert, and you certainly won't walk away from the talk as an expert, but you will learn what has helped me, and you will walk away with ideas that you can continue to learn about for the purpose of improving your leadership skills within your current and future roles.
