                    <li>With the move to take on more leadership responsibilities comes new challenges</li>
                    <li>Here are some of the ones which I've personally had to focus on adopting to/overcoming</li>
                    <li>We'll look at ways in which we can improve our communication/collaboration skills to increase
                        our effectiveness as leaders, as well as how we can help to grow the skills of others we work
                        with so that we can rely upon them (which is very important as you take on more and more
                        team-contributor tasks versus individual contributor tasks).
                    </li>
                    <li>On growing leadership skills... for me, the challenge for me was primarily due to being a fairly
                        emotionally crippled engineer. I wasn't trained in interacting with or communicating with
                        people. In fact, I got into working with computers because I thought it'd mean that I didn't
                        have to deal with a lot of people. I was apparently way off on that one...

                <li class="fragment fade-up">Leadership != Management</li>
                <li class="fragment fade-up">Influence as a leader != Manipulation through authority</li>
                <li class="fragment fade-up">Leadership is about integrity, vision, and getting others to voluntarily
                    follow you
                </li>

            <aside class="notes">
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of leaders do not have formal management positions or authority in the same sense that
                        managers do.
                    </li>
                    <li>Managers who are not good leaders are very unlikely to be successful in the long-term.</li>
                    <li>While a manager may have formal authority to force or otherwise manipulate others to take some
                        specific action, that is not at all what I'm referring to as I talk about influence throughout
                        this presentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Instead, influence as a leader is about the ability to motivate others to voluntarily follow
                        you.

                    <li>The content thus far has been not so much about leadership, but more about becoming effective in
                        your role as you take on additional leadership responsibilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>This is intentional, as it is difficult to be an effective leader if you are not at least
                        personally effective. A lot of literature on communication, leadership, and personal growth puts
                        an intentional focus on refining internal (intrapersonal) skills as the initial foundation upon
                        which external (interpersonal) skills are developed. I've utilized the same approach here, so
                        now we will move on to some interpersonal concepts, particularly communication here and then
                        collaboration in just a bit.
